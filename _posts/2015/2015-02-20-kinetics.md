##Rotation Matrix

$$p' = r^Tp$$

$$

\begin{matrix}
a & b\cr
c & d
\end{matrix}
$$

A rotation matrix attains tree equivalent geometrical meanings:

1. It describes the mutual orientation between coordinate frames;its column vectors are the direction cosines of the axes of the rotated frame with respect to the original frame.

2. It represents the coordinate transformation between the coordinates of a point expressed in two different frames(with common origin).

3. It is the operator that allows rotating a vector in the same coordinate frame.
